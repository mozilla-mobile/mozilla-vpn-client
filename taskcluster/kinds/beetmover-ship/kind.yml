    # Beetmoverscript doesn't support the `push-to-release` action for VPN
    # addons yet, as they use a slightly different directory structure on
    # archive.mozilla.org.
    #
    # For that reason, we need to use the `direct-push-to-bucket` action to
    # re-upload the build artifacts rather than copying them over from the
    # candidates dir. This means we need to depend on the build dependencies
    # even in the `ship` phase. We also depend on the `beetmover-promote` tasks
    # just to ensure we don't skip uploading to the candidates dir.
