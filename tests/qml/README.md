## To build and run the tests

* From a clean project at the root level
* `./scripts/utils/generate_glean.py`
* `./scripts/utils/import_languages.py`
* `qmake CONFIG+=QMLTEST`
* `make -j XX` (number of pricks you have)
* `./tests/qml/qml_tests`

## General notes, tips, etc.


You don't need to rerun `make` processes changes to `tst_*.qml` files.

I needed to make a property alias at a top level object to reference more nested things in the tests. There may be a better way where we're not cluttering up production code because of testing needs.

#### Setup order

The order in which things are setup is important.

The SettingsHolder is made in `main.cpp` so that there is an instance available for everything else to use.

The SettingsHolder must be instantiated for the FeatureList to be able to initialize.

#### QML imports / organization

It can be a struggle to get the thing you want to import imported.
Don't struggle alone, ask for help.
Hopefully it's just figuring out the right combination of:
  * the .qrc files under `/src/ui`
  * the `qmldir`s
  * the RESOURCES in `qml.pro`
  * the engine imports in `main.cpp`

Use `export QML_IMPORT_TRACE=1` before running your tests to get extra helpful information.

As an example, under `/src/ui` there is a `ui.qrc`. That file lists the prefix as `ui` and points to a qmldir file `src/ui/qmldir`. The qmldir file lists `Main` and points to `src/ui/main.qml`. In `qml.pro` I have `...src/ui.qrc` as a `RESOURCE`; in `main.cpp` I import `engine->addImportPath("qrc:///");` because that pulls in the qmldir `src/ui/qmldir`. Lastly I can then do `import ui 0.1` in my `test_mainWindow.qml` and I can make a `Main` window.
