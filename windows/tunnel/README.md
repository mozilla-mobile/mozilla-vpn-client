# Tunnel DLL

A simple yet effective way of leveraging the existing WireGuard codebase. This is more or less the same thing as the [embeddable-dll-service](https://git.zx2c4.com/wireguard-windows/about/embeddable-dll-service/README.md) from upstream [wireguard-windows](https://git.zx2c4.com/wireguard-windows/about/).

## Building

To build the embeddable dll service, run `.\build.cmd` to produce `x86\tunnel.dll` and `x64\tunnel.dll`.
