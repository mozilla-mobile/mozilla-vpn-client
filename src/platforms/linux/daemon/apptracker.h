// Applications on Linux can be a bit vague and hard to define at runtime, so
// we need to make some assumptions to try and tackle the problem.
//
// The first concept, comes from the Freedesktop specification, which makes use
// of desktop entry files to populate entities in the applications menu. The
// path to these files are used to generate identifiers, known as Desktop File
// IDs. This means that we can only track applications which are launched by
// the applications menu.
//
// The second contept are control groups, or cgroups, which are used to group
// process IDs together for the purpose of establishing shared resource
// contstraints. We use these control groups in the Linux netfilter subsystem
// to apply the split tunnelling traffic manipulation.
//
// It just so happens that many modern desktop environments will group their
// processes forked from the application launchers into cgroups for resource
// management and containerization. This class attempts to track those cgroups
// and match them to the destop file ID from which they originated.
//
// This means that we also only support desktop environments which make us of
// control groups for application containerization. This more or less limits us
// to Gnome, KDE, Flatpaks and Snaps.
