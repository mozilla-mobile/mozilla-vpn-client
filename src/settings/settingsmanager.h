/**
 * @brief The SettingsManager is a singleton class that manages the underlying
 * QtSetting storage object and serves the as the holder of all settings in the
 * codebase dynamic or static. The lifetime of this singleton is tied to the
 * lifetime of the QApplication.
 *
 * There are two types of settings currently in this codebase:
 *
 * * Static settings are settings defined at build time in a declarative manner
 * e.g. the SETTING macro or the EXPERIMENTAL_FEATURE macro.
 * * Dynamic settings are settings which are created on demand at runtime.
 *
 * All settings are created using SettingsManager::createOrGetSetting, which
 * creates a Setting object and registers it in the SettingsManager class.
 *
 * The only public constructor for Setting objects is
 * SettingsManager::createOrGetSetting, therefore everytime a
 * Setting object is created it is guaranteed to be registered in the settings
 * base.
