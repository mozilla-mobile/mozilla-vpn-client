/**
 * @brief The SettingsBase is a singleton class that manages the underlying
 * QtSetting storage object and serves the as the holder of all settings in the
 * codebase dynamic or static. The lifetime of this singleton is tied to the
 * lifetime of the QApplication.
 *
 * There are two types of settings currently in this codebase.
 *
 * * Static settings are settings defined at build time in a declarative manner
 * e.g. the SETTING macro or the EXPERIMENTAL_FEATURE macro.
 * * Dynamic settings are settings which are created on demand at runtime.
 *
 * All settings are created using the SettingsFactory, which creates a Setting
 * object and registers it in the SettingsBase class.
 *
 * The only public constructor for Setting objects is the SettingsFactory
 * constructor, therefore everytime a Setting object is created it is guaranteed
 * to be registered in the settings base.
