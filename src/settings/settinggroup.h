/**
 * @brief Represents a group of dynamic settings. Dynamic setttings can be
 * defined at runtime.
 *
 * This abstraction serves as an aggregator of underlying storage settings.
 * These settings necessarily need to be grouped under a QSettings group i.e.
 * their keys need to share the same prefix followed by a slash ("/").
 *
 * Because settings under a SettingsGroup can be dynamically generated, upon
 * initialization of a new SettingsGroup object the underlying storage is probed
 * for any stored setting with the group prefix and those settings are
 * registered to the SettingsManager.
 *
 * A SettingsGroups is useful when
 *
 * * Defining metrics dynamically at runtime is required or
 * * Reacting to changes for _any_ setting under the group is necessary or
 * * It makes sense to have metrics grouped for code semantics.
 *
 * It is allowed to create SettingGroups that are subsets or supersets of other
 * SettingGroups. However, this can be tricky if the different groups are
 * configured differently e.g. one has removeWhenReset set to true, while the
 * other has removeWhenReset set to false. Whichever group register the
 * underlying setting first will have their configurations enforced. There are
 * Q_ASSERTs set up in debug mode to catch such situations.
