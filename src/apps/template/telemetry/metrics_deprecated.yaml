# This file defines the metrics that are recorded by the Glean SDK.
# APIs to use these pings are automatically generated at build time using
# the `glean_parser` PyPI package.

# For the Metrics YAML Registry Format, see the official documentation:
# https://mozilla.github.io/glean/book/reference/yaml/metrics.html

# All the samples are stored in a single category (`sample`) to simplify the
# C++-JS integration which is currently based on QT signals. The samples are
# "normalized" as const strings via a script (`scripts/utils/generate_glean.py
# template`), and used in the C++ code to communicate with the JS code.
