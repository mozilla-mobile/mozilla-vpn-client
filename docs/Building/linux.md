# Building for Flatpak

The Mozilla VPN client supports building and distribution via flatpak, and is
available on Flathub at [org.mozilla.vpn](https://flathub.org/apps/org.mozilla.vpn).

The flatpak manifests for the latest stable release can be found at
[flathub/org.mozilla.vpn](https://github.com/flathub/org.mozilla.vpn), and this
project also contains a manifest for local development in the `linux/flatpak`
directory.

To build the flatpak package, start by installing the `org.flatpak.Builder` app:

```
   flatpak install -y flathub org.flatpak.Builder
```

Add the Flathub repo user-wide:

```
   flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists --user flathub https://dl.flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo
```

Then build the project manifest and install it:

```
   flatpak run org.flatpak.Builder --force-clean --sandbox --user --install --install-deps-from=flathub --ccache build-flatpak linux/flatpak/org.mozilla.vpn.yml
```

Once installed, the Mozilla VPN client can be run using the `org.mozilla.vpn`
app identifier:

```
   flatpak run org.mozilla.vpn
```
