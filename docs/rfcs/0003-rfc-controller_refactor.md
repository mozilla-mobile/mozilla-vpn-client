## Summary
Introduce a new `ConnectionManager` component which sits between the frontend and the controller to handle all connectivity related logic and keep the controller code lean and minimal.

## Motivation
The current controller code is complicated, lengthy, and bug-prone. Over time we have continued to directly add more logic and checks for various scenarios to the controller code, resulting in a Frankenstein monster that is hard to scale and keep under control.

Because our current approach is not scalable, we’ve been facing numerous issues in the connectivity space, especially when it comes down to identifying exactly what is causing the issue. This means the behavior of our client is extremely inconsistent both on different platforms but also within the same environment. For example, if a user loses network connectivity while the VPN is activated, sometimes they enter no signal, and other times they encounter the “server location unavailable” modal. This inconsistency is a result of racing checks and error reporting. The goal of this refactor is to combine all of these scenarios under one component and to get rid of the `ConnectionHealth` entirely to resolve this issue.


## Proposed Solution
Move all connectivity code out of the controller and into its separate component which is referred to as the `ConnectionManager` in this document. The controller object will continue to remain but its purpose will be drastically simplified to a few basic functionalities including `activate()` and `deactivate()`. We will no longer have any states associated with the Controller and all states will live in the `ConnectionManager`. The `ConnectionManager` will primarily act as a liaison between the controller and the UI.

```

The existing Connection Health object in VPN performs checks that act in the same space as the `ConnectionManager`. For example, in connection health, we periodically send pings and collect some data upon receiving (or not receiving) a response which allows us to draw conclusions regarding network connectivity and server availability. Because there is so much overlap within both classes, the creation and implementation of the Connection Manager component allows us to entirely get rid of connection health and move any remaining logic to `ConnectionManager`. We should be able to entirely eliminate the `ConnectionHealth` class as well as the states `NoSignal` and `Stable` given that they will be handled within the new Connection Manager logic. For example, currently, we may enter the No Signal state due to several reasons such as losing network connectivity, expired subscription, or server location becoming unavailable, this means that No Signal is simply a side effect of something else going wrong, and because we now have explicit messaging and checks for those, No Signal does not serve us and can be removed.

One exception to the rule is `ConnectionHealth::ConnectionStability::Unstable`. The connection health object periodically sends pings and measures the received responses to assess whether or not the network connectivity is stable. To continue notifying users about their unstable network, we will continue to use this state within `ConnectionManager`. 

Beyond the connectivity checks, the Controller also manages how much time has elapsed since the VPN was toggled on. Having this logic in the controller bloats the code without any gains, so I would like to move that code out of `Controller` and instead introduce a simple `Timer` object that encapsulates the related logic. The timer starts when the VPN enters State On since doing the initial checks may take a few seconds that we don't need to account for.

Because this is all part of a unified connectivity experience, we do not want to release bits and pieces of this until everything is implemented, tested, and ready to go, this means that all implementation will live behind a feature flag until we are ready to test and release.


## Implementation Plan
Introduce a new `ConnectionManager` component that is activated when the client is launched and connects to `networkWatcher` in case anything changes. This new component will manage the following work:
- Internet probe
- Firewall
- Captive portal check
- Server probe
- Subscription status

We will also add a new `Timer` component to keep track of how much time has elapsed since the VPN was activated. 


The `ConnectionManager` has various connection states to keep track of which connection related task the VPN is performing at any given point. This means that the `ConnectionManager` will communicate with the `Controller` so that the controller knows which state to enter at every stage. During one of the iterations of this proposal, someone asked if we can have signals instead of states in the `ConnectionManager`. The short answer is no. While emitting a signal to notify the UI about what we should be showing the user does the same thing, we still need to keep track of the current state internally so we know what to do next in case anything goes wrong at any other point.

Here is the proposed set of `ConnectionManager` states and how they map to the `Controller` states. Please note that some of these states may go away once we are further along the implementation (e.g. we may not need `ConnectionStateSilentSwitching` anymore):

```c++
  enum ConnectionState {
    ConnectionStateOff,  // Corresponds to controller states: StateInitializing,
                         // StateOff
    ConnectionStateInternetProbe,      // Corresponds to controller states:
                                       // StateConnecting
    ConnectionStateServerProbe,        // Corresponds to controller states:
                                       // StateConnecting
    ConnectionStateFirewall,           // Corresponds to controller states:
                                       // StateConnecting
    ConnectionStateCaptivePortal,      // Corresponds to controller states:
                                       // StateConnecting
    ConnectionStateCheckSubscription,  // Corresponds to controller states:
                                       // StateCheckSubscription
    ConnectionStateOn,  // Corresponds to controller state: StateOn

    // Mirrored from Controller states
    ConnectionStateSilentSwitching,  // Corresponds to StateSilentSwitching
    ConnectionStateSwitching,        // Corresponds to StateSwitching
    ConnectionStateConfirming,       // Corresponds to controller states:
                                     // StateConfirming
    ConnectionStateDisconnecting     // Corresponds to controller state:
                                     // StateDisconnecting
  };
```

If at any point any of the checks in `ConnectionManager::ConnectionStates` fails then we will emit a signal to the frontend explaining what exactly the issue is. For example, if we are in `ConnectionManager::ConnectionStateInternetProbe` and the internet probe fails, we will notify the frontend via `emit connectionStateInternetProbeFailed()` signal. This allows the UI to notify the user that the VPN activation failed due to their network connectivity issue and may offer troubleshooting advice such as checking that their wifi/cellular is enabled. It is worth noting that in any given circumstance, we will not deactivate the VPN on our end regardless of the failure. 

This change also means that prior to the activation of the VPN, there are multiple checks and probes that need to succeed; this will take some time (hopefully no more than a couple of seconds), and as long as we communicate to the user via front end prompts about what is happening, this is acceptable.

This is a big undertaking that will take multiple sprints to complete. This document does not cover the extent of work required for creating new unit and functional tests as well as updating the existing ones that will be affected. I propose we break down the work like below:

1. Create a new `ConnectionManager` object with relevant states. Initially, this will have a 1:1 map to the controller so we can debug and ensure the component works as intended. As we add the logic to probe for various scenarios and move further along the implementation work, we can remove them from the `Controller`.
2. Add probe internet to `ConnectionManager`
3. Add firewall probe to `ConnectionManager`
4. Add captive portal probe to `ConnectionManager`
5. Add check subscription to `ConnectionManager`
6. Add server probing to `ConnectionManager`
7. Get rid of the `ConnectionHealth` object
8. Audit and cleanup `Controller::stateChanged`. We need to audit all areas where code is listening to `Controller::stateChanged` and see if it should be monitoring the `ConnectionManager` instead, if that is the case, make the necessary changes. [Here](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-vpn-client/search?q=Controller%3A%3AstateChanged&path=&case=false&regexp=false) is a current list of every instance we should audit.
9. Move timestamp code to its own class/object


### Audit and cleanup `Controller::stateChanged`
Controller states are going away, so any code that was previously listening for `Controller::stateChanged` should now monitor the `ConnectionManager`.
