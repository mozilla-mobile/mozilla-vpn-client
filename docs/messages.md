# Messages

Messages, located in the Messages Inbox, are used to notify users about important information.

Technically, they are implemented as add-ons (see the add-on documentation).

The JSON files are validated via [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/) files:

On this page, we want to describe how to write a message.
