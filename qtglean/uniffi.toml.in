# We need to override glean_core's uniffi config (3rdparty/glean/glean-core/uniffi.toml)
# for kotlin only in order to provide uniffi with the correct cdylib_name. The glean_core
# symbols are on the mozillavpn lib for us, that is what we need to give to uniffi.
#
# Due to the way Qt does things the final lib name has also an `_arm64-v8a`
# suffix, so we have this template which will be used to generate the real thing
# with the right suffix on pre-build.
