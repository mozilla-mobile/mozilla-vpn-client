# Inspector for Mozilla VPN

# Building

The whole app is build with parcel. It will produce 
a single html file that can be bundled with the client.

```
npm install
npm run build
```
will yield `dist/index.html`


# Running standalone

You can also run the inspector stand-alone, for coding convinience. This also leaves the debug info in place:

```
npm install 
npm run dev 
```
